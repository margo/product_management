## PM group charter
 [PM Charter (Draft)](https://github.com/margo/product_management/pull/77)
- Adjust language around setting of technical direction in the mission statement and core responsibilities
- Representation of "readout to SC" should be shown as an output
- Should mention prioritization in conjunction with roadmap planning
- Add Clark Case as co-lead
- Define the meaning of active participation in the project or reference where this is defined
- Adjust language around marketing enablement (product messaging and positioning done by MWG, supported by PM group)
- Josh to add the above updates and call for approval before next week's call

## PM inputs to plugfest planning
- primarly focus on Margo members (steering, general and contributor). Expectation to have very strong representation of steering members.
- participant profile: developer, system architect.
- take go-nogo decision based on outcome survey, sensing for every Margo member's intent to join the March 2025 plugfest
- Expected outcome : more robust specification, with easy adoption through the right set of supporting tools for adopters
- secondary objective : strengthen the Margo technical community (=future adopters), with specific focus on providing contributing members an opportunity to network with the core Margo team
- participants bring Margo prototypes to focus on testing with their peers the Margo API interactions, file formats exchange/ingestion etc..
- it is not expected to perform conformance testing or running formal, structered test plans.
- the plugfest is not intended to be a forum to discuss scope, priorities or features. Focus is on implementability of confirmed PR1 specification.
