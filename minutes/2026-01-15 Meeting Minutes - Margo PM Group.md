# Plugfest coordination and conformance suite planning
Plugfest planning:
- C platzer not present. Topic moved to separate update call with C. Platzer to get status update and understand need for support/volunteers from PM team.

Conformance suite planning :
Strong consensus from PM team to start planning conformance test tools now, defining methodology, principles and framework, and build a first "vertical" slice of conformance test tools for a portion of PR1.
Objective : to proof out viability, adopter experience, understand effort required. subsequently, scale out the conformance test tools to the full GA1 scope. The experience and knowledge collected (=effort required) will help to better estimate GA1 milestone & roadmap, and reduce risk of drift in release date. 

TWG and PM will collaborate on this topic. Series of TWG meetings are scheduled. PM is invited. Please ensure you join the calls. PM calls have been shortened to accomodate for it.

# Margo roadmap for 2026
PM group agreed to shift focus in next 6 weeks to build a realistic plan for GA1 Scope and milestone, with the current consensus (GA1 on 15th September) as a starting point.

OBJECTIVE of this effort: ensure building a coherent, adoptable release, bringing incremental value and relevance to the market. 

Next steps:
- PM group to propose options and evaluate them in January to form a proposal in February, ready to be approved/voted during F2F Steerco Winter Summit (March 2026)
- A. Craig has scheduled a series of GA1 roadmap scope calls for PM + TWG. Please join.
